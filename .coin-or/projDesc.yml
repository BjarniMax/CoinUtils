  LongDescription:
  - |-
      The CoinUtils project is a collection of
      open-source utilities developed and used by a variety of other
      projects in the COIN-OR repository. The project includes
      classes for storing and manipulating sparse matrices and
      vectors, performing matrix factorization, parsing input files
      in standard formats, building representations of mathematical
      programs, comparing floating point numbers with a tolerance,
      performing simple presolve operations, and warm starting
      algorithms for mathematical programs, among others.
